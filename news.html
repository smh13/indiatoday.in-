            <p class="w3">Poll strategist Prashant Kishor has said he has no poll ambitions and only wants to work for the development of Bihar. However, he said that he will work with like-minded people and decide on launching a political platform later.</p>

             <p class="w5">Poll strategist Prashant Kishor on Thursday said that he will not announce a new political party or platform right now. He said he will work with like-minded people who want to bring about a “real change” in Bihar to bring about a positive change in the state.</p>    
            </p>
            <p class="w5">
                “I am not going to announce any new party, right now, as is being speculated in a section of the media. I am going to talk to around 17,000-18,000 people, who are aware of the problems in Bihar, and try to bring them on a single platform. We should be able to complete the process by August-September,” he said.

            <p class="w5">“If they think that a political platform needs to be launched to achieve the desired goals, we will decide on the same then. However, it won't be Prashant Kishor's party, it will be the people's party,” he said.</p>
            <p class="w5">Prashant Kishor said that the situation was necessitated by the 30 years of “misrule” by Lalu Prasad and Nitish Kumar. He said: “After 30 years of rule by Nitish Kumar and Lalu Prasad, Bihar is the most backward state in India. If Bihar has to develop, it can’t walk on the path it has been walking for the last 10-15 years. It needs a new direction.”</p>
            <p class="w5">“Bihar’s future needs a concerted effort by all. It can’t be done by one person. People who really want to bring about a change in Bihar must come together,” he said. “Bihar’s education system and healthcare infrastructure are in a shambles. Bihar’s youth have to go out of the state to look for jobs. This needs to change,” he told mediapersons.</p>

            <p class="w5">He also announced a 3,000 km ‘padyatra’.</p>
            <p class="w5">On May 2 morning, Prashant Kishor had put out a cryptic tweet, saying that he would turn to the “real masters, the people,” to understand the real issues.</p>
            <p class="w5">Earlier, in an interview with the BBC he had said, “After the Bengal elections, I announced I would not be any party in my earlier capacity. This includes TMC in Goa and beyond. But, it doesn’t mean that I won’t be part of any election. I will not be part of elections in my earlier capacity.”</p>
            <p class="w5">The May 2 tweet came just a few days after he turned down the Congress’ offer to join the party. Prashant Kishor had said that Congress is capable of revival on its own and does not need him.</p>
